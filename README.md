### Team Thunder




This is the project repo for the final project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car. For more information about the project, see the project introduction [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/6047fe34-d93c-4f50-8336-b70ef10cb4b2/modules/e1a23b06-329a-4684-a717-ad476f0d8dff/lessons/462c933d-9f24-42d3-8bdc-a08a5fc866e4/concepts/5ab4b122-83e6-436d-850f-9f4d26627fd9).

This project was a team project. This team consisted of 5 members.

### Overview
This is the architecture of the system used to drive CARLA.
![alt text](https://github.com/SharadRawat/SDCND_system_integration/blob/master/imgs/final-project-ros-graph-v3.png)

The initial repository provided by Udcaity has a basic structure of the archtecture and the corresponding ROS nodes. There are 3 ROS nodes we work on for completetion of the project: 

They are:
1. Waypoint Updater Node
2. BW Node
3. Traffic Light Detection Node

Let's look into each =>

1. **Waypoint Updater Node**

    This package contains the waypoint updater node: `waypoint_updater.py`. The purpose of this node is to update the target velocity property of each waypoint based on traffic light and obstacle detection data. This node will subscribe to the `/base_waypoints`, `/current_pose`, `/obstacle_waypoint`, and `/traffic_waypoint topics`, and publish a list of waypoints ahead of the car with target velocities to the `/final_waypoints topic`.




2. **DBW node**

   DBWNode subscribes to the current velocity and way points that are published by waypoint_updator node. These topics are then processed using the two control logics below to determine the final throttle, steering and brake ratio, to maneuver the vehicle smoothly along the waypoints. 

    - Subscribes to topics: `/current velocity`, `/twist_cmd`, `/dbw_enabled`
    - Publishes to topics: `/steering_com`, `/throttle_cmd`, `/brake_cmd` 	

   

   DBW node then processes vehicle's throttle/brake and steering control using models below

   - twist_control.py: vehicle throttle control using PID and low-pass filter 
   - yaw_control.py: steering control with a  simple vehicle dynamics model and linear/angular velocity

   

   We've set the proportional, integral, and differential values for PID as below.

| Type              | Value |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| Proportional (Kp) | 0.2   |
| Integral (Ki)     | 0.002 |
| Differential (Kd) | 0.005 |


3. **Traffic detection node and Traffic light classification**


    This package contains the traffic light detection node: `tl_detector.py`. This node takes in data from the `/image_color`, `/current_pose`, and `/base_waypoints` topics and publishes the locations to stop for red traffic lights to the `/traffic_waypoint topic`.

    The `/current_pose topic` provides the vehicle's current position, and `/base_waypoints` provides a complete list of waypoints the car will be following. You will build both a traffic light detection node and a traffic light classification node. Traffic light detection should take place within tl_detector.py, whereas traffic light classification should take place within `../tl_detector/light_classification_model/tl_classfier.py`. For classification, a SSD_mobilenet model is depolyed using tensorflow object detection API. A detailed information about the classifier can be found [here](https://github.com/allaydesai/Traffic-Light-Classifier/blob/master/README.md).




### For Installation
Please use **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation.

### Native Installation

* Be sure that your workstation is running Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus or Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahir. [Ubuntu downloads can be found here](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop).
* If using a Virtual Machine to install Ubuntu, use the following configuration as minimum:
  * 2 CPU
  * 2 GB system memory
  * 25 GB of free hard drive space

  The Udacity provided virtual machine has ROS and Dataspeed DBW already installed, so you can skip the next two steps if you are using this.

* Follow these instructions to install ROS
  * [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 16.04.
  * [ROS Indigo](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu) if you have Ubuntu 14.04.
* [Dataspeed DBW](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros)
  * Use this option to install the SDK on a workstation that already has ROS installed: [One Line SDK Install (binary)](https://bitbucket.org/DataspeedInc/dbw_mkz_ros/src/81e63fcc335d7b64139d7482017d6a97b405e250/ROS_SETUP.md?fileviewer=file-view-default)
* Download the [Udacity Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone/releases).

### Docker Installation
[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

Build the docker container
```bash
docker build . -t capstone
```

Run the docker file
```bash
docker run -p 4567:4567 -v $PWD:/capstone -v /tmp/log:/root/.ros/ --rm -it capstone
```

### Port Forwarding
To set up port forwarding, please refer to the [instructions from term 2](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77)

### Usage

1. Clone the project repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone.git
```

2. Install python dependencies
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Make and run styx
```bash
cd ros
catkin_make
source devel/setup.sh
roslaunch launch/styx.launch
```
4. Run the simulator

### Real world testing
1. Download [training bag](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/traffic_light_bag_file.zip) that was recorded on the Udacity self-driving car.
2. Unzip the file
```bash
unzip traffic_light_bag_file.zip
```
3. Play the bag file
```bash
rosbag play -l traffic_light_bag_file/traffic_light_training.bag
```
4. Launch your project in site mode
```bash
cd CarND-Capstone/ros
roslaunch launch/site.launch
```
5. Confirm that traffic light detection works on real life images
